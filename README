      |- phase2.cpp
      |- phase3.cpp
  |- Assembly Codes

      |- factorial.asm


HOW TO RUN:-
       On the terminal :-

       g++ phase1.cpp -o ./a
        ./a


Phase 1:-
Parsed the input file(.asm) and convert it into machine code.

Phase 2:-
Implemented data path and control paths to run the Instructions.
Implemented all stages i.e. Fetch, Execute, Decode, Memory, Writeback
Implemented inter state buffers, memory unit and register files for the same

Phase 3:-
Pipelined/(Unpipelined) Stalling, Forwarding, Static Branch Prediction.


FEATURES:-
    Functionality to switch between 
        1. Non- pipelined
        2. Pipelined with stalls
        3. Pipelined with Data forwarding
  
    Branch Prediction : Static and Always Not Taken
    Misprediction Penalty : 2 stalls
